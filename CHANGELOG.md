## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added CelebA dataset.
- Added CIFAR10 dataset.
- Environment variable EDFLOW\_GIT enables git integration.
- Minimal logger now supports list of handlers.
- pdb support. Use `import edflow.fpdb as pdb; pdb.set_trace()` instead of
  `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`.
- TFMultiStageTrainer and TFMultiStageModel
    - adds interface for model and trainer to derive from to support multiple stages. For example pretraining and training.
    - example can be found in `examples/multistage_trainer`
- `edlist` shows process group id (`pgid`), see FAQ.
- method `probs_to_mu_sigma` in `tf_nn.py` to estimate spatial mean and covariance across multiple channels.
- CHANGELOG.md to document notable changes.

### Changed
- Removed colons from log directory names and replaced them by hyphens.
- `LambdaCheckpointHook` uses global step and doesn't save on first step.
- Switched opencv2 functions with manual ones to get rid of the dependency.
- `edeval` now allows for differnet callback interface via the config. Callbacks are now entered as `dicts`, which allows to also pass keyword arguments to the callbacks from the config.
- `make_batches` now produces deep batches of examples. See documentation of `deep_lod2dol` or the section "Datasets and Batching" in the documention.
- `make_var` was broken for period variables because subcommands lacked `**kwargs` in definition. This is fixed now.

### Removed
- It is no longer possible to pass callbacks as list via the config
